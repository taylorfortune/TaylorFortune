## Hi there 👋

<!--
I'm Taylor, a UI/UX engineer based in Maryland.

I love shaping interfaces that flow with speed and accessibility. Away from code, I’m drawing, writing , lifting, or exploring anime worlds.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. I also enjoy writing blog post here portfolio https://www.yourstrulytay.com/
